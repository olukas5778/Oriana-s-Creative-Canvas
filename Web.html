      <h2>Filtered Coffee (1st Project) </h2>
      <h3> For my first UX project, I designed the foundations of a coffee shop for users in Harrisonburg. I created this design my sophomore year of college in my first User Design class at JMU. I went through the initial research process by interviewing seven users. I asked each person how they chose when to get coffee, where they typically went, how many coffee shops they new of around the area and what pain-points they experience when getting coffee. I then built a card sort to measure how the users think about the content. This allowed them to drag and drop what categories they thought belonged together. I then compiled the data to get the base of a potential app created six design requirements and 2 personas to build a narrative for this <a href="images/userresearch.pdf" target="_blank">app</a>.  </h3>

      <h2>ConServe (2nd Project)</h2>
      <h3> This was my biggest project that I've worked on and one that I am most proud of. For this project I worked in a group with two other members to design an app named ConServe that reduced food waste. This was a semester-long project that was broken down into several design phases. </h3>
    


<h2>Brainstorming</h2>
      <h3> The first phase consisted of brainstorming a common problem that people struggle with. After coming up with three problems, we presented each problem and solution to the class. Based on feedback, we chose the problem of food-waste. We then moved on to the interviews and wireframing. Each member conducted five interviews asking people about their shopping habits, how often they waste food, how they feel when food is wasted, ect. Based on these answers, we created affinity diagrams and wireframes to categorize our findings. </h3> </div>

      <h2>Visualizing and organizing </h2>
       
        <h3> With these categories we created journey maps and personas to visualize our users. Once we did this, we started focusing on the app's features. The biggest 
        function our app would have, was a feature that would scan grocery items and organize them into folders in the app. Once organized, the app would keep track of the expiration dates. To distinguish this app from other apps, we created a function that allowed for the third party account to automatically upload the items when scanned at the store. </h3> </div>

Overall, this was my strongest project and one that allowed me to discover my passion for UX research and design</h3>

    <h2> Java Joint Website </h2>
      <h3> This was my final project for my Interactive Design course I took my junior year. For the assignment we could design a website based off of any idea using Sublime and Bootstrap. I chose to design a website for a coffee shop, <a href="https://olukas5778.github.io/Final-Java-joint/index.html" target="_blank"> Java Joint. </a> For this project, I learned the grid-layout of pages and how to properly use "containers" in html to design my page. I also used various HTML techniques such as carousels and drop down menus to display my content. Along with the HTML, I used CSS to properly code the design of my site. The CSS altered colors, fonts, sizing, and background so my site looked aesthetically pleasing. I also designed all the accompanying graphics including the logo. After the site was finished, I then published to Github pages.</h3> </div>

      <h2> Empowering explorers</h2>
      <h3> For a web design and theory class I took my senior year of college, my group and I were tasked with designing a website of our choice. As we were all passionate about traveling, we decided to create a travel blog. We focused the blog towards a younger audience traveling on a budget. We each had to write five content pieces about our individual experiences and choose the logistics of our website.</h3>
      <h3> Once we had selected the typography and color schemes we wanted to use and completed our written pieces, we created the final product using Wordpress. We inserted our stories and photos from our trips throughout the site and used a template for the overall design. </h3>

        <h3>This project required lots of team work and designating duties. I had the duty of the "About Us" page, and my individual content. Below are screenshots of our "Homepage", our "About Us" page, and our "Posts" of destinations. We all had to be sure to communicate with each other on our decision making for the site and thankfully everyone excelled in this area. </h3> </div>
